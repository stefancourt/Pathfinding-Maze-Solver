    "\n",
    "The maze solver can be seen as a search problem because it is a pathfinding question with a start and goal, where a path that leads to the destination must be found and can be found, depending on the algorithm, in a certain amount of time. the # and the - are elements that determine what is a wall and what is the path. This means that a search algorithm will be able to tell what each node represents being a path or a wall. Also it can be seen as a search problem because there are multiple paths that lead to the solution however one path is better then the rest, and so different algorithms can find different paths according to different time and space complexities."

    "### Solving the maze using Depth-First Search\n",
    "In depth-first search you start at the root node and as far down each branch to different nodes before backtracking. One problem with this algorithm is that there is a possibility for looping within nodes where the search algorithm will be stuck between a certain number of nodes because theres is a cycle within the tree; this means that the algorithm does not have completeness. the time complexity for the algortihm is high being *branches^maxDepth* this is because in the worst case the algorithm visits all states multiple times. the space complexity for the algorithm is low being the *maxDepth* as only one path is being remembered at a time. The algorithm also is not guaranteed to find the shortest solution, as if there are multiple solutions it will find the one that is in the closest to the inital branch."

    "A star is an algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start to an end goal. It is done by calculating a total cost by adding a heuristic  and actual cost to reach the end cell. The heuristic cost is created by calculating the absolute distance of the cell from the goal both horizontally and vertically, whereas the actual cost is calculated by adding one to the previous cells actual cost and is the distance from the starting position. We then trace back through the lowest scores to give us the shortest distance to the goal cell.\n",

The time complexity of A star is *branches^depth*. In its worst case it is the same as DFS, but under most circumstances it will be faster. However the space complexity of A star is *branches^depth* which is worse then DFS."

    "A star algorithm has a faster execution time for the easy and medium maze over DFS is due to the algorithm completing in a better time and space complexity. If you look at path taken for each maze that has been solved you can see that it is always the shortest path possible. Also if you examine the difference between the amount of nodes explored from A star to depth first, A star has a much smaller amount of nodes explored. As the manhattan distance is a good heuristic function for the algorithm, the time to complete is very fast. Also because the maze is quite dense in the Very Large maze, the algorithm is much faster then depth first search.\n",
