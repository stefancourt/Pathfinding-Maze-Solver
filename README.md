# Python Pathfinding Maze Solver

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Author
[Stefan Court(https://github.com/stefancourt)

## 📖 Program contents
The notebook contains 3 maze solving algorithms that each contain descriptions. these 3 algorithms are Depth-First search, A* search and Breadth-First Search. When running either of these programs they will output the time taken to complete the maze, the number of nodes in the path, the number of nodes explored and the resulting path taken. This path taken is written to a corresponding file for the algorithm and maze.

## ❓ How to run the program
Every cell of code within the program can be run independently without having to rely on dependencies from eachother this means that it does not matter what order you run the cells they will always work. To run the program for a custom maze for each program you will need to write *algorithm("maze.txt")*. the mazes are located in the **mazes** folder, and the solutions are found in the **algorithm_path_solutions** folder.
